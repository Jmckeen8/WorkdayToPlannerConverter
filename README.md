# WorkdayToPlannerConverter

This is a converter tool that looks for a prod-data.json file obtained from [this link](https://courselistings.wpi.edu/assets/prod-data.json) and generates a new.schedb XML file which may be used as schedule data for the WPI Scheduler/Planner tool. I'm using it in conjunction with my own hosted version of this tool located at [https://jmckeen8.github.io/wpiplanner/](https://jmckeen8.github.io/wpiplanner/). The repository for that hosted version of the scheduler is located [here](https://github.com/Jmckeen8/wpiplanner).
