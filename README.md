# WorkdayToPlannerConverter

This is a companion data parser tool for the WPI Planner. It ingests the prod-data-raw.json file from the Workday feed and provides a new.schedb file that the WPI Planner can read.

For more information see the README on the [main repository](https://github.com/Jmckeen8/wpiplanner).
