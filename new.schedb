II   By using material from the sciences and the humanities this course examines the ways in which ideas of knowledge and of human nature have been fashioned. The specific topics include physical theories about light, biological and psychological theories of visual perception, and artistic theories and practices concerned with representation. The mixing of material from different academic disciplines is deliberate and meant to counter the notion that human pursuits are “naturally” arranged in the neat packages found in the modern university. The course draws upon the physical and social sciences, and the humanities, to examine how those fields relate to one another, and how they produce knowledge and self-knowledge. Cultural as well as disciplinary factors are assessed in this process.  Light, Vision, and Understanding is conducted as a seminar. The diverse collection of reading materials includes a number of primary texts in different fields.

program-design material from CS 2102, but assumes that students have significant prior experience in object-oriented programming. The course covers object-oriented design principles and data structures more deeply and at a faster pace than in CS 2102. Students will be expected to design, implement, test, debug, and critique programs both for correctness and adherence to good object-oriented design principles. The course is designed to strengthen both the design skills and algorithmic thinking of students who already have a foundation in object-oriented programming. Recommended background: CS 1101 or CS 1102 and significant prior experience writing object-oriented programs from scratch. Advanced Placement Computer Science A courses should provide sufficient background; students from AP CS Principles courses or gentler introductions to Java Programming are advised to take CS 2102 instead. Students may receive credit for only one of the following three courses: CS 2102, CS 210X, CS 2103.

The course begins with the introduction of the concepts of data security, where classical algorithms serve as an example. Different attacks on cryptographic systems are classified. Some pseudo-random generators are introduced. The concepts of public and private key cryptography are developed. As important representatives for secret key schemes, DES and IDEA are described. The public key schemes RSA and ElGamal, and systems based on elliptic curves are then developed. Signature algorithms, hash functions, key distribution and identification schemes are treated as advanced topics. Some advanced mathematical algorithms for attacking cryptographic schemes are discussed. Application examples will include a protocol for security in a LAN and a secure smart card system for electronic banking. Special consideration will be given to schemes which are relevant for network environments. For all schemes, implementation aspects and up-to-date security estimations will be discussed.

Numerous applications are presented to motivate coverage of fundamental operating principles of circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors; model the signals produced by these sensors; and analyze the circuits and systems used to amplify and process these signals. After a review of Kirchhoff ‘s current and voltage laws, fundamental analysis techniques such as Thevenin and Norton’s theorems and the superposition principle are used to model and analyze sensors, circuits, and systems. Concepts from analysis of linear, time-invariant continuous-time signals and systems are introduced as necessary, including Fourier series and characterization of systems such as filters in both the frequency domain (bandwidth, transfer function) and time domain (rise time, step response). Capacitance, inductance and mutual inductance are explored as energy storage elements, including consideration of resonance and energy losses in power systems. Concepts will be reinforced with the use of laboratory exercises and computer simulation.  Recommended background: ECE 2010, MA 1024 (or equivalent), PH 1120/21 and MA 2051 (concurrent).

This course explores these foundations by using modern digital design techniques to design, implement and test digital circuits ranging in complexity from basic logic gates to state machines that perform useful functions like calculations, counting, timing, and a host of other applications. Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment. Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential circuits, and synchronous state machines. Lab exercises: Design, analysis and construction of combinational and sequential circuits; use of hardware description languages to implement, test, and verify digital circuits; function and operation of FPGAs.

Using popular everyday devices as case studies, students in this course are introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed by embedded systems. Students will then solve real-world design problems using small, resource constrained (time/memory/power) computing platforms. The hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic interactions between embedded computers and the physical world will also be covered in lecture and as part of laboratory experiments. In the laboratory, emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD display, SPI ports, pulse width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed to use embedded processors in systems design. This course is also appropriate for RBE and other engineering and CS students interested in learning about embedded system theory and design. Topics: Number/data representations, embedded system design using C, microprocessor and microcontroller architecture, program development and debugging tools for a small target processor, hardware/software dependencies, use of memory mapped peripherals, design of event driven software, time and resource management, applications case studies. Lab Exercises: Students will solve commonly encountered embedded processing problems to implement useful systems. Starting with a requirements list students will use the knowledge gained during the lectures to implement solutions to problems which explore topics such as user interfaces and interfacing with the physical world, logic flow, and timing and time constrained programming.

II  Experimental economics is a set of methods for testing hypotheses about behavior. Traditional economic analysis using naturally occurring data is often confounded by the complexities of the real world. Economic experiments, on the other hand, give researchers the control required for isolating behaviors of interest. As such, economic experiments can be useful tools for testing existing theories and establishing empirical regularities assisting in the development of new theories. In this course, we cover the basic principles of experimental design. We also study a number of classic experiments, on topics ranging from the efficiency of markets to decision-making under uncertainty and behavioral game theory. Students will participate in mock experiments and will begin putting their new skills into practice by designing their own experiments, which may serve as the basis for IQPs/MQPs.

II    It is apparent that environmental problems have outgrown national policy frameworks. Thus, institutions have emerged at the international and transnational levels to coordinate collective problem solving. But governance involves more than just the practicality of problem solving; it also involves uncertainty, controversy, power and politics. This course will examine the ways in which global environmental governance has been conceived: from establishing international institutions and agreements, to less tangible ways of interacting. We will examine themes such as scales of governance (from the United Nations to communities), policy networks, the role of NGOs, think tanks and special interests and the role of knowledge in global environmental debates. Students will then use this conceptual and theoretical basis to analyze major global environmental issues including: deforestation; biodiversity; endangered species; and climate change.

Society puts a strong emphasis on extroversion, and those that speak up often get heard the most and have their careers advanced the fastest. Yet some of our greatest thinkers and leaders have been introverts.  However, the culture of WPI and the professions where team work is integral present challenges to introverts. Learning to work with others is crucial for career success. This course will help introverted students learn to thrive at college and throughout their careers. Students will learn about the nature of introversion, including the strengths and challenges of being an introvert. Students will also learn pertinent skills, such as how to successfully work on a team, give a presentation to a crowd, manage their energy levels, and have difficult conversations with others.

II   By using material from the sciences and the humanities this course examines the ways in which ideas of knowledge and of human nature have been fashioned. The specific topics include physical theories about light, biological and psychological theories of visual perception, and artistic theories and practices concerned with representation. The mixing of material from different academic disciplines is deliberate and meant to counter the notion that human pursuits are “naturally” arranged in the neat packages found in the modern university. The course draws upon the physical and social sciences, and the humanities, to examine how those fields relate to one another, and how they produce knowledge and self-knowledge. Cultural as well as disciplinary factors are assessed in this process.  Light, Vision, and Understanding is conducted as a seminar. The diverse collection of reading materials includes a number of primary texts in different fields. In addition, the students keep a journal in which they record the results of numerous individual observations and experiments concerning light and visual perception. The course can fit into several areas of depth as well as serve as a starting point for an IQP. There are no specific requirements for this course, although some knowledge of college-level physics, as well as an acquaintance with the visual arts, is helpful.

Design applications are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is based on the premise that there are common aspects to all good designs. These commons aspects, stated in the independence and information axioms, facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline. Analysis of processes and products is considered from the perspective of supporting product and process design. Fundamental methods of engineering analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are developed. Attention is given to examples from one or more of the following: machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surface topographies.

II  The field of Psychophysiology seeks to answer two key questions: (1) How do psychological factors – like our feelings, attitudes, relationships, behaviors, and social environments – get “under the skin” to affect our physiology? (2) How can we infer someone’s psychological state based on a physiological measurement? For instance, how do different stimuli affect our heart rate? And in turn, if someone’s heart is beating faster, might we infer that they are nervous or that they are excited?

Certainly, a director’s concept and interpretation are the driving forces in producing and mounting a live performance of a script. But she doesn’t do it alone. In this course, we will discuss the cornerstones of theatrical production design, from interpreting a script to creating onstage symbology. We explore the various disciplines involved in theatrical design, from scenery to costumes, lighting to sound, props to projections. We’ll start by analyzing a script and discussing the intention of the playwright far beyond the written word. From there, we will determine what the physical needs of the production are in order to propel the story. We’ll then dive deeper, tapping into the creative, aesthetic aspects of design, not just the function, but the form. By dissecting the nuance of a script and reading between the lines, we’ll discover the poetry in good design and why it takes a live performance beyond the basics of the plot.

The course will be focused on disease characterization for more advanced audiences and preparation for future graduate and professional writing in medicine or the life sciences.    Students may not receive credit for both WR 4210 and WR 421X.    Recommended background: Prior courses or projects (GPS, IQP) in health, medicine, or science writing. Exposure to anatomy and physiology would be helpful. The course is designed for 3rd and 4th year students with a strong interest in pursuing careers or continued education in medicine or public health.
