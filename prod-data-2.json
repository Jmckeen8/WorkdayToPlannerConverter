Topics include control structures, iterators, functional decomposition, basic data structures (such as records). Students will be expected to implement, test and debug programs. Through the use of compelling applications and lab exercises, students will learn how to interface with external data systems and control devices.Recommended background: none. All Computer Science students and other students wishing to prepare for 3000-level courses in Computer Science should take CS 1101/1102 instead of CS 1004. This course provides sufficient background for CS 2301 Systems Programming for Non-Majors.</p>",
