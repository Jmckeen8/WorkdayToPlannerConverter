The specific topics include physical theories about light, biological and psychological theories of visual perception, and artistic theories and practices concerned with representation. The mixing of material from different academic disciplines is deliberate and meant to counter the notion that human pursuits are “naturally” arranged in the neat packages found in the modern university. The course draws upon the physical and social sciences, and the humanities, to examine how those fields relate to one another, and how they produce knowledge and self-knowledge. Cultural as well as disciplinary factors are assessed in this process.</p><p>Light, Vision, and Understanding is conducted as a seminar. The diverse collection of reading materials includes a number of primary texts in different fields. In addition, the students keep a journal in which they record the results of numerous individual observations and experiments concerning light and visual perception.

I</p><p>Embedded computers are literally everywhere in modern life. On any given day we interact with and depend on dozens of small computers to make coffee, run cell phones, take pictures, play music play, control elevators, manage the emissions and antilock brakes in our automobile, control a home security system, and so on. Using popular everyday devices as case studies, students in this course are introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed by embedded systems. Students will then solve real-world design problems using small, resource constrained (time/memory/power) computing platforms. The hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic interactions between embedded computers and the physical world will also be covered in lecture and as part of laboratory experiments. In the laboratory, emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD display, SPI ports, pulse width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed to use embedded processors in systems design. This course is also appropriate for RBE and other engineering and CS students interested in learning about embedded system theory and design. Topics: Number/data representations, embedded system design using C, microprocessor and microcontroller architecture, program development and debugging tools for a small target processor, hardware/software dependencies, use of memory mapped peripherals, design of event driven software, time and resource management, applications case studies.

II</p><p>Experimental economics is a set of methods for testing hypotheses about behavior. Traditional economic analysis using naturally occurring data is often confounded by the complexities of the real world. Economic experiments, on the other hand, give researchers the control required for isolating behaviors of interest. As such, economic experiments can be useful tools for testing existing theories and establishing empirical regularities assisting in the development of new theories. In this course, we cover the basic principles of experimental design. We also study a number of classic experiments, on topics ranging from the efficiency of markets to decision-making under uncertainty and behavioral game theory. Students will participate in mock experiments and will begin putting their new skills into practice by designing their own experiments, which may serve as the basis for IQPs/MQPs. If time permits, we will discuss some of the basic methods for analyzing experimental data, which presents challenges somewhat different from naturally occurring data due to small sample sizes.</p><p>Recommended Background: ECON 1110 This course will be offered in 2019-20, and in alternating years thereafter.</p>","Subject":"Economics","Delivery_Mode":"In-Person","Academic_Level":"Undergraduate","Section_Status":"Open","Credits":"3","Section_Details":"Washburn 323 | T-F | 12:00 PM - 1:50 PM","Offering_Period":"2021 Fall B Term","Starting_Academic_Period_Type":"B Term","Course_Tags":"Degree Attribute :: Social Sciences; Offering Pattern :: Category II","Academic_Units":"Social Science and Policy Studies Department","Course_Section":"ECON 2155-B01 - Experimental Economics","Enrolled_Capacity":"4/35","Course_Section_End_Date":"2021-12-10","Meeting_Day_Patterns":"T-F","Course_Section_Owner":"Social Science and Policy Studies Department"},{"Course_Section_Start_Date":"2021-10-20","Meeting_Patterns":"M-R | 10:00 AM - 11:50 AM","Course_Title":"ECON 2910 - Economics And Entrepreneurship","Locations":"Washburn 229","Instructional_Format":"Lecture","Waitlist_Waitlist_Capacity":"0/0","Course_Description":"<p>Cat.

Knowledge of the root causes of environmentally harmful behavior is essential for designing effective solutions to environmental problems. The goals of the course are (1) to provide students with the basic social science knowledge needed to understand and evaluate the behavioral aspects of such important environmental problems as air and water pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, preserving biological diversity, and hazardous waste and (2) to help students identify and improve shortcomings in their knowledge and decisions related to the environment. Topics will include, but not be limited to: environmental problems as “tragedies of the commons”; public understanding of global warming and global climate modeling; folk biology; risk perception; intelligent criticism of environmental claims; making effective environmental choices; strategies for promoting pro-environmental behavior; and human ability to model and manage the global environmental future.

II</p><p>Social media platforms are changing the world of social movements, giving rise to a new generation of social activism. Social media can enable local actors to link with others from across the globe to incite social and environmental change. Social media has enabled people to document and share injustices (e.g., violence; dumping of toxic waste) in places where freedom of the press is limited or non-existent, and it has enabled people across different social groups (race, class, etc.) to engage with one another on issues of shared concern. Social media has also allowed people to share resources (financial, expertise, and organizational) with other social actors across the globe, empowering communities in novel ways. This course introduces students to the phenomena of social and environmental movements, theories on why they succeed and fail, and how social media has changed the landscape of social mobilization. This course will draw on interdisciplinary readings, concepts, and case studies from the social sciences, with emphasis on geography, public policy, sociology, and media studies. Course work will include small group projects, analyses of current social movement cases, and a final project. The final project will consist of interviewing members of a current social movement (potentially using social media), evaluating whether particular social media applications have helped to enable social mobilization, and designing new or revised social media tools to further enhance social mobilization.

I</p><p></p><p>This beginning course provides important background for all science and engineering disciplines regarding the capabilities and limitations of materials in our everyday lives. Students are introduced to the fundamental theme of materials science-- structure-property-processing relationships—in metals, ceramics, and plastics. Aspects of material structure range from the atomic to microstructural and macroscopic scales. In turn, these structural features determine the properties of materials.

Thus, institutions have emerged at the international and transnational levels to coordinate collective problem solving. But governance involves more than just the practicality of problem solving; it also involves uncertainty, controversy, power and politics. This course will examine the ways in which global environmental governance has been conceived: from establishing international institutions and agreements, to less tangible ways of interacting. We will examine themes such as scales of governance (from the United Nations to communities), policy networks, the role of NGOs, think tanks and special interests and the role of knowledge in global environmental debates. Students will then use this conceptual and theoretical basis to analyze major global environmental issues including: deforestation; biodiversity; endangered species; and climate change. The goals of this course are to gain an understanding of the main positions in global environmental debates; critically analyze these positions; and gain insight into the politics of global environmental policy and governance.</p><p></p><p>Recommended Background: GOV 1303 or GOV 1320</p><p>This course will be offered in 2019-20, and in alternating years thereafter.</p>","Subject":"Government, Political Science and Law","Delivery_Mode":"In-Person","Academic_Level":"Undergraduate","Section_Status":"Open","Credits":"3","Section_Details":"Salisbury Labs 105 | M-R | 9:00 AM - 10:50 AM","Instructors":"Laureen Elgert","Offering_Period":"2021 Fall B Term","Starting_Academic_Period_Type":"B Term","Course_Tags":"Degree Attribute :: Social Sciences; Offering Pattern :: Category II","Academic_Units":"Social Science and Policy Studies Department","Course_Section":"GOV 2319-B01 - Global Environmental Politics","Enrolled_Capacity":"11/35","Course_Section_End_Date":"2021-12-10","Meeting_Day_Patterns":"M-R","Course_Section_Owner":"Social Science and Policy Studies Department"},{"Course_Section_Start_Date":"2021-08-25","Meeting_Patterns":"M-T-R-F | 10:00 AM - 10:50 AM","Course_Title":"HI 1311 - Introduction To American Urban History","Locations":"Salisbury Labs 305","Instructional_Format":"Lecture","Waitlist_Waitlist_Capacity":"0/0","Course_Description":"<p>Cat.

Do you enjoy spending time alone? Does the thought of working on a team make you nervous? Are you shy around your classmates? Do you tend to avoid small talk or get tongue-tied? Would you rather think about a problem than discuss it with others? If you answered yes to several of these questions, this course is for you. Society puts a strong emphasis on extroversion, and those that speak up often get heard the most and have their careers advanced the fastest. Yet some of our greatest thinkers and leaders have been introverts.</p><p>However, the culture of WPI and the professions where team work is integral present challenges to introverts. Learning to work with others is crucial for career success. This course will help introverted students learn to thrive at college and throughout their careers. Students will learn about the nature of introversion, including the strengths and challenges of being an introvert. Students will also learn pertinent skills, such as how to successfully work on a team, give a presentation to a crowd, manage their energy levels, and have difficult conversations with others.

II</p><p><br />By using material from the sciences and the humanities this course examines the ways in which ideas of knowledge and of human nature have been fashioned. The specific topics include physical theories about light, biological and psychological theories of visual perception, and artistic theories and practices concerned with representation. The mixing of material from different academic disciplines is deliberate and meant to counter the notion that human pursuits are “naturally” arranged in the neat packages found in the modern university. The course draws upon the physical and social sciences, and the humanities, to examine how those fields relate to one another, and how they produce knowledge and self-knowledge. Cultural as well as disciplinary factors are assessed in this process.</p><p>Light, Vision, and Understanding is conducted as a seminar. The diverse collection of reading materials includes a number of primary texts in different fields.

Design applications are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is based on the premise that there are common aspects to all good designs. These commons aspects, stated in the independence and information axioms, facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline. Analysis of processes and products is considered from the perspective of supporting product and process design. Fundamental methods of engineering analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are developed. Attention is given to examples from one or more of the following: machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surface topographies.

II This course will explore automatic mechanical (electro)acoustic instruments, the people that design and build them and the music that they make. The subject is inherently interdisciplinary, so activities will engage with historical, musical, and technical matters. The history of automatic mechanical instruments reaches back centuries: we will study past designs so that we can better contextualize modern efforts, which have progressed alongside increasing computational power and machine sensing abilities. We will consider the music that has been composed using such instruments including the works of Anthiel, Nancarrow, Ligeti, Gann, and Metheny. In doing so, we will develop analytical tools required to understand such music and will illuminate relationships between electromechanical capabilities and musical ideas. The technical components of this course will introduce students to principles involved in instrument design, actuators, electronic circuits, microcontrollers, and musical programming environments. We will do all of this with our mind open to the question of how we can design new machines to make new kinds of music. Recommended Background: Fundamentals of Music I and / or Fundamentals of Music II, experience with programming and electronic circuits is helpful.

(2) How can we infer someone’s psychological state based on a physiological measurement? For instance, how do different stimuli affect our heart rate? And in turn, if someone’s heart is beating faster, might we infer that they are nervous or that they are excited? In this course, we will cover fundamental stress physiology (e.g., the nervous system, neuroendocrinology, the immunity system etc.), advanced methodologies for assessing psychophysiological constructs (e.g., electromyography, neuroimaging, biospecimens), and both foundational and emerging findings from the field.

I<br />This course is an in-depth consideration of the meaning, value, and consequences of scientific inquiry. Questions explored may include: Does science yield truth? Are the results of scientific inquiry more a reflection of the workings of the human mind than of those of the external world? Do pivotal scientificconcepts like gene, electron, photon, species, and ecosystem point to entities that actually exist? Does the history of science, which includes many refutations of theories once believed to be true, raise questions about whether currently accepted theories should be trusted? By what methods does a scientific community validate knowledge claims and how are these processes affected by social, political, and economic contexts? Does a scientist have a responsibility to conduct morally conscientious research?<br />How does the development of technology affect our spiritual and moral characters? In what ways is science similar to religion and in what ways is it different? The focus of this course may vary each time it is offered from an examination of science in general to an investigation of the foundations of specific branches of science such as physics, biology, environmental science, or social science.<br />Recommended Background: PY/RE 1731, Introduction to Philosophy and Religion or PY/RE 2731, Introduction to Ethics.</p>","Subject":"Philosophy","Delivery_Mode":"In-Person","Academic_Level":"Undergraduate","Section_Status":"Open","Credits":"3","Section_Details":"Salisbury Labs 305 | M-R | 12:00 PM - 1:50 PM","Instructors":"Jennifer McWeeny","Offering_Period":"2021 Fall A Term","Starting_Academic_Period_Type":"A Term","Course_Tags":"Degree Attribute :: Humanities and Arts; Offering Pattern :: Category I","Academic_Units":"Humanities and Arts Department","Course_Section":"PY 2719-A01 - Philosophy Of Science","Enrolled_Capacity":"20/50","Course_Section_End_Date":"2021-10-13","Meeting_Day_Patterns":"M-R","Course_Section_Owner":"Humanities and Arts Department"},{"Course_Section_Start_Date":"2021-10-20","Meeting_Patterns":"M-R | 10:00 AM - 11:50 AM","Course_Title":"PY 2731 - Ethics","Locations":"Higgins Labs 116","Instructional_Format":"Lecture","Waitlist_Waitlist_Capacity":"0/10","Course_Description":"<p>Cat.

Do moral values change over time, making beliefs about right and wrong simply &#34;relative,&#34; or are moral values objective, holding true for all people, everywhere, at all times? Should emotions play a role in ethical deliberation, or should we aspire to be purely rational when engaged in moral thought and action? Is it okay to cheat on an exam, so long as everybody else does it? Do we have a right to use animals in laboratory experiments? Is eating meat ethical? Is it wrong to share a racist or sexist joke? Should abortion be legal? Students will learn how to apply key moral concepts to real-world problems and situations after closely studying several moral theories, including utilitarianism, Kantianism, and feminist care ethics.

Should emotions play a role in ethical deliberation, or should we aspire to be purely rational when engaged in moral thought and action? Is it okay to cheat on an exam, so long as everybody else does it? Do we have a right to use animals in laboratory experiments? Is eating meat ethical? Is it wrong to share a racist or sexist joke?

Certainly, a director’s concept and interpretation are the driving forces in producing and mounting a live performance of a script. But she doesn’t do it alone. In this course, we will discuss the cornerstones of theatrical production design, from interpreting a script to creating onstage symbology. We explore the various disciplines involved in theatrical design, from scenery to costumes, lighting to sound, props to projections. We’ll start by analyzing a script and discussing the intention of the playwright far beyond the written word. From there, we will determine what the physical needs of the production are in order to propel the story. We’ll then dive deeper, tapping into the creative, aesthetic aspects of design, not just the function, but the form. By dissecting the nuance of a script and reading between the lines, we’ll discover the poetry in good design and why it takes a live performance beyond the basics of the plot. </span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Recommended background: None</span></span></span></span></p></div>","Subject":"Theatre","Delivery_Mode":"In-Person","Academic_Level":"Undergraduate","Section_Status":"Open","Credits":"3","Section_Details":"Salisbury Labs 105 | M-R | 12:00 PM - 1:50 PM","Offering_Period":"2021 Fall A Term","Starting_Academic_Period_Type":"A Term","Academic_Units":"Humanities and Arts Department","Course_Section":"TH 111X-A01 - Introduction To Theatrical Production Design","Enrolled_Capacity":"8/20","Course_Section_End_Date":"2021-10-13","Meeting_Day_Patterns":"M-R","Course_Section_Owner":"Humanities and Arts Department"},{"Course_Section_Start_Date":"2021-08-25","Meeting_Patterns":"M-T-R-F | 2:00 PM - 2:50 PM","Course_Title":"TH 1221 - Introduction to Drama - Theatre on the Page and on the Stage","Locations":"Salisbury Labs 105","Instructional_Format":"Lecture","Waitlist_Waitlist_Capacity":"0/0","Course_Description":"<p><i>Cat.
